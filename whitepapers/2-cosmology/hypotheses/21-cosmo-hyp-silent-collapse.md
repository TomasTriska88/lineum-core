> **[OEA MACRO-TOPOLOGY RECTIFICATION PENDING]** This hypothesis relies on the archaic V6 interpretation of $\mu$ as an explicitly calculated memory field. Recent macro-simulations (The OEA Topological Limit) mathematically prove that mass is an instantaneous, emergent topological byproduct of overlapping space grids ($\Phi$), requiring no arbitrary time-decay variables. This recontextualizes the mechanical analogies described below without invalidating the broader philosophical intent.

# Hypothesis: Silent Collapse of a Quasiparticle (Tříska’s Silent Collapse Hypothesis)

## Author / Origin

T. Tříska (2025)

---

## Hypothesis

Quasiparticles in the Lineum system can decay in regions with high φ and near-zero spin (|curl| < 0.02), without leaving behind a vortex structure, trajectory, or other topological trace.

We refer to this process as **silent collapse** – decay without imprint, without residue, without reaction.

Conditions under which silent collapse occurs:

- φ > 0.25
- |curl| < 0.02
- effective particle mass m < 0.01 × mₑ
- no vortex or structural imprint in φ

---

## Testing Status

- ✅ Confirmed in all runs of `spec1_true`, `spec1_false`, `spec2_true`, `spec2_false`
- ✅ `phi_curl_low_mass.csv` shows that most quasiparticles decaying in regions φ > 0.25 had |curl| < 0.02
- ✅ Decay occurs even with active noise (independence from `LOW_NOISE_MODE`)
- ✅ Visualizations (`lineum_spin.gif`, `frames_curl.npy`) show no residual flow

## Context of `TEST_EXHALE_MODE`

This mode adjusts simulation parameters towards **slower dynamics, higher dissipation, and longer quasiparticle lifetimes**. This increases the probability that an excitation spontaneously decays in a local φ-maximum without energy emission.

It is designed specifically for testing hypotheses related to:

- quiescent decay of quasiparticles (e.g., silent collapse),
- closure without energy emission,
- structural memory of the φ field.

Outputs for analysis include:

- `phi_curl_low_mass.csv` – values of φ and curl in locations with extremely low effective mass,
- `trajectories.csv` – tracking of particle movement before decay,
- `multi_spectrum_summary.csv` – spectral composition at the location and time of closure.

## Calculation Methodology

### Simulation Parameters:

```python
TEST_EXHALE_MODE = True
LOW_NOISE_MODE = True / False
steps = 1000
linon_scaling = 0.01
disipation = 0.002
```

### Key Outputs:

- `phi_curl_low_mass.csv` – confirmation of collapse conditions
- `lineum_spin.gif` – check for residual flow
- `trajectories.csv` – course and lifetime of particles
- `phi_center_log.csv` – confirmation of quiescent φ-field

---

## Significance

Silent collapse represents a special form of decay – **not as an event**, but as **dissolution**. Energy is not dispersed, information does not remain. The Lineum field simply "forgets" that the particle ever existed.

The hypothesis expands the interpretation of φ's structural memory – it shows that in addition to closure (see Tříska’s Structural Closure Hypothesis), complete **erasure** can also occur.

---

## Recommended Further Tests

- Monitor the φ-field at silent collapse locations on a larger scale (`256×256`)
- Compare with closure – it is possible that both forms are related to the flow regime
- Insert a foreign particle into a silent decay location and verify if it "reincarnates" the original structure
- Statistically quantify the difference between silent collapse and structural closure

---

## Conclusion

Tříska’s Silent Collapse Hypothesis describes a phenomenon where a quasiparticle in Lineum decays without a vortex, memory, or trace. This decay is **energetically and topologically null**, but it is not random – it occurs in quiescent φ structures.

**…and sometimes forgets.**
