# Lineum Appendix – Equation History

---

## 1. Title & Scope

Chronological record of the main Lineum equation’s development, documenting all major revisions from the initial formulation to the current form presented in the core paper. This appendix preserves each historical variant, the reasons for changes, and observed impacts on simulation outcomes.

---

## 2. Motivation

The equation in the core paper represents the current, most refined formulation of the Lineum model. However, its development involved multiple iterations, parameter adjustments, and structural changes. Recording this history allows:

- Reproducibility of past results,
- Understanding of why certain terms were added, modified, or removed,
- Providing context for future experiments and related hypotheses.

---

## 3. Main Content

> **Note:** The latest equation form is **Version 7**. Its canonical expression is given in the core paper: see [Equation section](./lineum-core.md#3-equation).
> In the canonical form, **κ** is a **static spatial map** (no time evolution) that _modulates_ parameters locally (e.g., α_eff = κ·α, β_eff = κ·β) rather than directly replacing **α** or **β** in the φ-update.

**Terminology.** Throughout this appendix, we use **linon** to denote a stable, localized |ψ|² excitation (i.e., the quasi-particle of the Lineum model).

In the experimental context of the broader project, **DTH** denotes the **Dimensional Transparency Hypothesis** – a working hypothesis (not an established mechanism) about how changes in κ might affect the “visibility” of simulated structures when interpreted in terms of a prospective detector setup.

> **Interpretation note:** Terms like “gravity” or “gravitational” in this appendix describe **gravity-like patterns in the simulation**, not a confirmed physical gravitational force in nature.

### 🔹 Version 1 – Purely oscillating field

```text
ψ ← ψ + 𝛌̃ + ξ + φψ − δψ + ∇²ψ
```

The first version contained only the ψ field. It generated linons, spin, and vortices, but did not allow accumulation or emergent attraction. The φ field was not yet dynamic.

- ✅ Generated **linons** and flows
- ❌ No accumulation or emergent gravity-like behavior (in the simulation)
- ❌ φ was static, without memory

---

### 🔹 Version 2 – Introduction of the accumulation field φ

```text
φ ← φ + (|ψ|² − φ) + ∇²φ
```

Introduced in response to the question “what causes attraction?”.  
The φ field began reacting to the density |ψ|² and creating stable maxima.

- ✅ φ-traps appeared for the first time
- ✅ **Linons** started to linger in them spontaneously
- ⚠️ ψ flow still did not distinguish the direction toward the gradient of φ

---

### 🔹 Version 3 – Emergent gravity-like behavior through ∇φ

> **Note:** This change affects the ψ field equation, unlike Version 2 which introduced the φ field equation.  
> It represents the first direct coupling of ψ to φ through its gradient.

```text
ψ ← ψ + 𝛌̃ + ξ + φψ − δψ + ∇²ψ + ∇φ
```

By adding the gradient of φ, a gravity-like flow pattern emerges in the simulation – **linons** move into regions where φ increases.

- ✅ Gravity-like behavior (in the model) without an explicit force term
- ✅ Formation of φ-centers, attraction, accumulation
- ✅ The overall model has memory, interaction, and trajectory

---

### 🔹 Version 4 – Introduction of the tuning field κ

```text
φ ← φ + κ (|ψ|² − φ) + κ ∇²φ
```

> **Post-hoc note (canonical alignment):** In the core paper’s **Equation section** ([link](./lineum-core.md#3-equation)), **κ** appears as a **static spatial map** with `κ ← κ(x, y)`, and the φ-update keeps  
> `φ ← φ + α (|ψ|² − φ) + β ∇²φ`.  
> The multiplicative κ shown above is retained here as a **historical snapshot** of the development stage.

By introducing the tuning field κ, the system’s response can be controlled locally – where the field “reacts” and where it is “deaf”.  
In connection with the current Dimensional Transparency Hypothesis (DTH) test setup, κ appears to influence **visibility** in the simulation – in low-κ regions we typically do not observe particle or vortex formation. This is an empirical observation of the model, not a confirmed statement about any physical detector.

### 🔹 Version 5 – Introduction of Numerical Stabilizers & Artificial Damping

As the simulated interactions grew more complex in the continuous PDE solver, the field |ψ| became prone to numerical explosions. To counter this, a suite of stabilizers (soft bounds) were introduced directly into the Euler integration:
- **Global Linear Dissipation:** `ψ ← ψ - 0.005 ψ` (constantly draining energy to find a stable equilibrium)
- **Non-Linear Soft Clipping:** `N_term ← N_term / (1 + |N_term| / 10.0)` (soft saturation without hard cutoffs)

- ✅ Prevented numerical infinities and allowed stable visual execution on grids.
- ❌ Acted as unphysical dampening, destroying natural wave resonance, suppressing true standing waves, and enforcing artificial dissipation.

---

### 🔹 Version 6 – Structural Memory Field μ (HDD)

```text
μ ← μ + η (|ψ|² - thresh) κ - ρ μ
ψ_flow_term ← ∇φ_flow * κ * (1 + μ)
```

The μ field was introduced as a long-term "hard drive" memory to record persistent, structurally stable energetic pathways. By observing regions of consistently high activity, the system slowly etches pathways that further accelerate or route incoming wave energy. Crucially, it featured an extremely slow decay rate (`ρ = 0.0001`).
- ✅ Allowed the system to remember and reinforce stable macroscopic pathways (routing/structural grooves).
- ✅ Differentiated the fast reacting φ "RAM" from the deeply etched μ "HDD".

---

### 🔹 Version 7 – The Unitary Wave Core & Removal of Global Damping (Current)

```text
ψ ← ψ + N(ψ) dt/2
ψ ← FFT_Unitary(ψ, dt)
ψ ← ψ + N(ψ) dt/2
```

*Note: The global linear dissipation (`ψ ← ψ - 0.005 ψ`) from Version 5 was explicitly removed from the wave propagation step.*

By shifting from explicit heat-like diffusion to a mathematically rigorous Strang-split unitary step (via FFT) for spatial propagation, the core dynamics became purely wave-like (Schrödinger analogy). With this exact geometric energy conservation in the linear step, the ubiquitous artificial global damping was no longer needed for stability and was deleted.
- ✅ Restored true cymatic resonance, standing waves, and quantum-like bound states without arbitrary energetic strangulation.
- ✅ Stability is now maintained naturally through the interplay of unitary propagation and localized environmental interaction.
- ✅ Emulates an Open Quantum System: $\psi$ acts as the unitary core, while $\phi$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ act as the open coupled environment.

### 🔹 The Continuous PDE Limit (Symbolic Form)

> **Note:** This is not a new chronological version, but the **theoretical continuous limit** of the canonical discrete update rule (V7).

```text
∂ₜψ = ∇²ψ + φψ + ∇φ
∂ₜφ = α(|ψ|² - φ) + β∇²φ
```

While Lineum is fundamentally a discrete computational model (cellular automaton), its dynamics analogize to continuous physical fields. When stripped of discrete step mechanics, artificial damping, noise, and the spatial performance mask ($\kappa$), the universe's core engine reduces to this elegant PDE pair.
This continuous formulation serves as the **canonical emblem** of the Lineum project—representing the pure mathematical concept of wave diffusion, memory interaction, and emergent gravitational drift, unburdened by algorithmic implementation details.

---

### 🔹 Version 8 – The String Tension Limit & Quantum Collapse

```text
ψ_collapse ← sigmoid(amp + grad_mag_phi) * kappa (The Boundary Tear)
```

As the discrete model was formalized philosophically, Version 8 defined the **Continuous-Field Physical Interpretation**. It established that "quantum collapse" is not probabilistic magic, but rather the phase field hitting the *hard mechanical ceiling of the Laplacian string tension* and violently redistributing. It also established the speed of light ($c$) as explicit **Processor Lag**—where heavy topological knots require dense cyclical updates, causing their internal states to tick slower relative to flat vacuum (Relativistic Time Dilation).

---

### 🔹 Version 9 – The Extreme Gradient Boundaries (Hawking Evaporation & Jet Emission)

Version 9 shifted focus from particle formation to macro-gravitational limits (Critical $\phi$-Traps / Black Holes).
- **Hawking Radiation:** At the extreme shear boundary of a deep $\phi$-trap, the steep gradient `grad_mag` geometrically forces the spontaneous generation of $\psi$ virtual pairs. Those with enough outward kinetic diffusion escape, leading to the gradual geometric unwinding (evaporation) of the $\phi$ tension well.
- **Astrophysical Jets:** When a $\phi$-trap becomes maximally saturated and can dig no deeper (`PHI_CAP`), the immense $\nabla^2\psi$ repulsive diffusion violently overcomes the saturated in-flow, blowing the excess $\psi$ energy outward along the topological axis of rotation, creating collimated relativistic back-pressure Jets.

## 4. Discussion

This progression shows a shift from a minimalistic ψ–φ interaction model to a more versatile three-field system capable of sustaining richer emergent structures **within the simulation**. Each modification was driven by simulation feedback and aimed at increasing stability, scalability, and interpretability of the model, not by fitting any specific physical constant or established gravitational law.
