# Hydrogen 2D Ground State Validation (Wave Core)

This report validates the ability of the Eq-7 Unitary Wave propagator to maintain strongly bound quantum states.

> [!WARNING] IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS (DISCLAIMERS)
> - This is a **2D analog**, not actual 3D spatial chemistry.
> - We implement a **Soft Coulomb potential** $V(r) = -Z / \sqrt{r^2 + \epsilon^2}$ to avoid asymptotic grid singularities.
> - Computed on a continuous 2D grid with **periodic boundary conditions**. The results are valid only if the wave function remains strongly localized and doesn't spill across boundaries.
> - **Absolute energy** (E) is not directly calibrated to physical SI or Hartree atomic units; the metric solely demonstrates algorithmic convergence and cross-system conservation.
> - We do not simulate *multi-electron* chemistry (Pauli exclusion, filled orbital shells). This is a single-electron test case.

## Methodology

1. **Phase A (ITP - Imaginary Time Propagation)**: The system is cooled via the `diffusion` mode. E and <r> mathematically converge into the stable energy minimum well.
2. **Phase B (Unitary Wave Propagator)**: The solver switches to the pure unitary FFT step (`wave_baseline`). The system must maintain its density and central grid localization perfectly, despite the propagator continuously driving wave diffraction.

## Periodic-Edge Sanity

To mathematically prove periodic boundary wrapping does not shatter the atomic geometry through artificial edge interference, we measure `edge_mass` (the ratio of mass concentrated in the outer 10% grid border relative to total mass) and `max_edge` (peak amplitude near the edge).

### Visual Bound-State Demonstration (Log Scale)
![Hydrogen Orbital](hydrogen_orbital_log.png)

- The levitating cloud oscillates non-radiatively within the potential well.
- Plotted via **log-scale** to visually prove the wave function absolutely decays exponentially at the grid edges (black region), rendering internal periodic boundary interference totally negligible (see metric: 1.33e-01).
