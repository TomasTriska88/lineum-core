# Lineum™

> **"No Magic, Just Structure."**
> Emergence of stable localized excitations in discrete fields without physical constants.

Lineum is an open research project investigating whether particle-like structures ("linons") and field-mediated interactions can arise from simple, local update rules on a discrete grid, without embedding any physical laws or constants a priori.

## 📂 Project Structure

This monorepo contains three distinct components:

| Component | Path | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | `/` | The simulation engine and audit tools. | Python 3.11 |
| **Portal** | `/portal` | Official web interface and knowledge base. | SvelteKit (Node) |
| **Lab** | `/lab` | "Simulacrum" - Interactive 3D visualizer. | Svelte/Vite |

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run and develop the various components of the monorepo, you need the following prerequisites installed on your system:
*   **Git** (for version control and project hooks)
*   **Python 3.11** (required for **Core**)
*   **Node.js (LTS version)** (required for **Portal** and **Lab**)

---

## 🔬 Core (Simulation Engine)
The heart of the project. A Python-based engine that runs the discrete field updates.

*   **Entry Point**: `lineum.py`
*   **Documentation**: `whitepapers/lineum-core.md` (Scientific paper)
*   **Usage**:
    ```bash
    # Run a simulation
    python lineum.py
    ```
*   **Audit**: See `whitepapers/` for full scientific methodology or [Verification Checklist](docs/verification_checklist.md) for independent reproduction.

### ⚡ Hardware Acceleration (CUDA/GPU)
Lineum Core runs on standard CPU (NumPy) by default and does **not** force heavy GPU dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
However, for massive scientific grid runs, reference pack generations, or local testing, you can seamlessly unlock **10x-30x speedups** if you have an Nvidia GPU:
1. Install PyTorch with CUDA support locally: `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`
2. The core physics engine (`lineum_core/math.py`) will **auto-detect** the GPU and automatically route tensor calculations through hardware CUDA cores.

### 📦 Reference Pack
For independent offline verification without reproducing the entire run, download the pre-built reference pack from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TomasTriska88/lineum-private/releases) page (attached as an asset to `v*` tags).

To verify the downloaded pack:
```bash
python scripts/verify_reference_pack.py --pack <path_to_downloaded_zip>
```

## 🌐 Portal (Web Interface)
The public face of Lineum ([lineum.io](https://lineum.io)). It serves as:
1.  **Wiki**: Hosting the whitepapers and documentation.
2.  **Context**: Explaining the mission and finding linons.
3.  **Lina**: An AI assistant with full context of the project.

*   **Deployment**: Deployed to Railway from `main`.
*   **Safety**: Uses `npm run safe-merge` to ensure quality.

---

## 🧪 Lab (Simulacrum)
An interactive 3D laboratory for visualizing field data and harmonics.

*   **Status**: Experimental / Visualizer.
*   **Tech**: Three.js + Svelte.
*   **Deployment**: Deployed to Railway as a static site.

---

## 🔬 Research & Audits
The `research/` directory contains exploratory materials, raw-data logs, and non-canonical working documentation.
*   **Purpose:** This is the project's internal scratchpad for testing hypotheses (e.g. `research/audits/`). 
*   **Disclaimer:** Documents located here are **not official product docs**, they make **no marketing claims**, their content is highly volatile, and they frequently document explicit *failed tests* used to map the engine's theoretical boundaries. Do not extrapolate these logs into official Lineum capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Workflow

### Git Protocol
*   **`dev` branch**: All development happens here.
*   **`main` branch**: Production releases only.

### How to Deploy (Portal)
We use a **Safe Merge** protocol to prevent broken builds in production.
```bash
cd portal
npm run safe-merge
```
This script runs tests, builds the site, checks for i18n issues, and only then merges `dev` into `main` and pushes.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
### Localhost vs 127.0.0.1 (Windows IPv6 Bug)
SvelteKit (Vite) development servers on Windows frequently bind to the IPv6 loopback (`::1`) while browsers attempt to resolve `localhost` via IPv4. This results in standard `npm run dev` endpoints returning a **404 error** or `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.
To bypass this, always run the dev servers bound explicitly to IPv4 via `--host` and navigate to the numeric IP:
```bash
# Portal
npx vite dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173

# Lab
npx vite dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5174
```
**Do not use `localhost`** in the browser in these cases, always use `http://127.0.0.1:5173` explicitly.
