# Lineum Commercial & API Strategy

## 1. The "Open-Core" Business Model
Lineum operates on a dual-layer strategy:
- **Core Technology (Open Source):** The underlying mathematical engine (Continuous Field Dynamics, Tensor calculations) is open and accessible. This builds academic trust, peer review, and community adoption.
- **Enterprise API Solutions (Proprietary / Paid):** The production-ready infrastructure built on top of the core.

### Why Companies Pay for the API:
1. **Infrastructure & Scaling:** Running massively parallel tensor fields requires specialized DevOps, auto-scaling clusters, and memory handling. The API abstracts this into a single HTTP request.
2. **SLA & Reliability:** B2B clients demand 99.9% uptime and dedicated support (Service Level Agreements). An open-source repository provides zero guarantees.
3. **Time-to-Market:** Integrating the API takes 3 lines of code (e.g., in JavaScript or Python). Building custom cloud infrastructure around the open-source core takes months of engineering hours.
4. **Proprietary Wrappers:** The API layer provides "Secret Sauce" features not found in the math core: geographical API bindings (GeoJSON/Mapbox), intelligent route caching, specific formatting, and hardware optimization.

### 1.1 The 4 Laws of Monetizing Open-Source (The "Laziness Tax")
To build absolute trust and developer hype, Lineum's entire math engine and book-generation pipeline is completely open-source. However, our marketing explicitly weaponizes this transparency by adhering to four psychological laws of COSS (Commercial Open-Source Software):

1. **Gabe Newell's Rule (Monetizing Convenience):** *"Piracy is a service problem."* We give the raw science and scripts away for free. We know 99% of customers are intrinsically lazy. They do not want to configure Node.js, install Playwright, and compile code. They will happily pay for the beautiful physical book or the 1-click cloud API, proving we are selling frictionless convenience, not just information.
2. **Spolsky's Strategy (Commoditize the Complement):** By open-sourcing the UI and mathematical renderer, we drive its cost to zero and make it universally accessible. This astronomically increases the value of our actual proprietary bottlenecks: the premium physical Lineum Books and our B2B spatial enterprise endpoints.
3. **The Tom Sawyer Effect:** By showing our cards openly (public repositories, GitHub CI/CD), we invite the global developer community to audit our math and stress-test our pipelines for free. They build the hype, debug the engine, and market the tool organically, while we hold the trademark and commercial distribution keys.
4. **O'Reilly's Rule:** *"Create more value than you capture."* Lineum drops massive, undeniable value into the public domain. This builds unshakeable brand authority. By the time a client hits our checkout page, the trust barrier is effectively zero.

## 2. API Product Verticals & General Purpose Framework
**CRITICAL:** Routing is currently the primary showcase, but **Lineum is a generalized physical solver.**
The architecture and marketing portal must always reflect the growing suite of tools:

### Vertical A: Spatial Solvers (Routing, Swarms)
- Swarm Routing (Primary Active Module)
- Structural stress testing
- Fluid dynamics & aerodynamic bounding
- Supply chain equilibrium (economic fields)

### Vertical B: True Random Number Generation (TRNG) & Entropy
Lineum Engine natively outputs mathematically pure entropy derived from structural Zeta-points and the $\varphi$ tensor field.
1. **Fast Entropy API (The Vacuum Noise):** A massive throughput endpoint reading microscopic phase fluctuations in the vacuum, acting as a TRNG for standard web cryptography and session keys.
2. **Extreme Zeta Entropy API (The Quantum Chaos):** A premium B2B endpoint artificially generating mathematically rare Riemann Zeta points via geometric collapse. Generates computationally unbreakable sequences matching the GUE pattern for national security and post-quantum vaults.
3. **Web3 Oracle API (ZK-Proof Trusted Seed):** Specialized Zeta entropy formatted directly for elliptic curve generation in zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-Rollups) and smart contracts requiring a "trusted setup".
4. **LineumHash API (Topological One-Way Function):** A physical, non-algorithmic hash function mapping a user payload into initial wave disturbances, collapsing into an irreversible $\varphi$ geometry. Immune to Shor's algorithm on quantum computers.
5. **Provably-Fair Gaming API (Zeta-Certified RNG):** High-precision bounded generation (e.g., `[1, 49]`) equipped with mathematical simulation logs proving physical origination, tailored for statistical audits in gambling.

    - **Security & Output Format:** To guarantee zero mathematical exposure of the "Universal Topology" or Zeta proofs, the raw $\psi/\varphi$ coordinate data is **never returned**. The output is always obfuscated, mixed from concurrent simulations, and returned as a JSON object containing a pure Hexadecimal/Base64 string.
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "source": "lineum_quantum_chaos_trng",
      "entropy_hex": "e7b9a23f8c01d4a9...9f1a"
    }
    ```

*Marketing Rule:* Always present "Lineum API Solutions" as a unified enterprise suite where physics solve previously impossible computational bottlenecks.

## 3. The Dual-Revenue Model: Enterprise API + Open-Source Donations
While the primary revenue engine is the Enterprise API, **Open-Source Donations (e.g., GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, BuyMeACoffee) are highly recommended.** 

### Why Donations and Paid APIs are not mutually exclusive:
1. **Audience Separation:** 
   - *Donations* come from individual academic researchers, students, and indie developers who love the math and use the open-source repository locally.
   - *API Payments* come from B2B Corporations (Logistics, Manufacturing) who need SLA guarantees and cloud infrastructure. A corporation will not use "Donations" to secure their production infrastructure; they require a legal API contract.
2. **Community Goodwill:** Having a prominent "Support the Open-Source Core" button next to the "Buy API Key" button reinforces the Open-Core philosophy. It shows corporations that they are funding a beloved academic project, which acts as positive PR.
   
*Implementation Rule:* The UI should strictly separate these calls to action. The main portal Header should focus on the API (B2B), while the GitHub README and the Portal Footer/Wiki should feature the Donation links heavily (B2C/Academic).

## 4. Legal & Terms of Service (ToS) Requirements
Before full public API launch, the following must be legally drafted by counsel:
1. **API Usage Limits & Rate Limiting:** Clear definitions of mathematical complexity limits per API call to prevent computationally bankrupting the server.
2. **Data Privacy (GDPR/CCPA):** Defining whether Floorplans, Grid Matrices, and logistical data sent to the API are stored for model training or immediately flushed from RAM.
3. **SLA Definitions:** Explicitly defining what constitutes downtime.
4. **License Distinction & Architectural Boundaries (Open-Core):** 
   - **Open Source Math Engine (AGPLv3):** The `lineum` core mathematical codebase will be explicitly licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)**. This preserves auditability and scientific integrity while preventing "wrapper-reselling."
   - *Why AGPLv3?* AGPL dictates that anyone offering the engine as a network-facing service must release their source code if they modify the AGPL code or tightly couple it. Separate auxiliary services (billing, frontend) can remain proprietary only if there is a strict architectural boundary.
   - **Proprietary SaaS Layer (`lineum-portal` / `lineum-saas`):** The orchestration, API gateway, authentication, billing, and scaling mechanics are completely separate. While you (Tomáš Tříska) are the sole Copyright holder and have dual-licensing rights, we will enforce a strict API/Process separation where the SaaS wrapper only calls the AGPL core engine as a remote service. This guarantees zero license contamination and proves the proprietary code is an independent orchestrator, not a derivative work.

5. **Intellectual Property (Trademarks & Patents):**
   - **Trademarks (Lineum™):** The brand name "Lineum", the logo, and the portal design are distinct from the open-source code. We must begin using the ™ symbol (e.g., Lineum™ API Solutions) across the portal to establish "common law" trademark rights. Once revenue begins, a formal registered trademark (®) should be filed in target jurisdictions (EUIPO/USPTO) to prevent competitors from confusing the market.
   - **Patents:** While abstract mathematical formulas (Eq-7) are generally not patentable, the *specific application* of Continuous Field Dynamics to *scalable network routing* via parallel tensor hardware can be patented as a "Software/Hardware Apparatus". If patenting is a long-term goal, a provisional patent application should be filed *before* making the repository fully public, to secure the priority date.

## 4. Marketing Tone
- **Confident, not defensive:** We don't hide that the math is free. We celebrate it. *"The math is open. The millisecond-reliability is guaranteed by our cloud."*
- **Developer-Centric:** Speak to engineers. Show them code snippets. They are the ones who will convince their CTOs to buy the API instead of building it.
- **Relentlessly Highlight Competitive Advantages:** Always visually prioritize features and metrics that traditional discrete algorithms (like A* or Dijkstra) cannot physically achieve. Massive concurrent scaling O(1), sub-millisecond continuous tensor evaluations, and complete elimination of graph bottlenecking must be the central, unmissable focal points of any product showcase.
